# Algorithms for Calculating Ï€

## Leibniz Formula

The first algorithm that I used was the [Leibniz formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80). This formula was simple but couldn't calculate last floatingPoint numbers accurately. Even if I calculated up to 2<sup>17</sup> elements of the series, it could only pass the first test.

## Spigot Algorithm of Rabinowitz and Wagon

The second algorithm was the [Spigot Algorithm of Rabinowitz and Wagon](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algorithms/SpigotForPi.shtml). This algorithm was better than the previous one and could pass all tests. However, the downside is that it is very slow. I had to increase the maximum value of i of sigma up to 16,000 to pass the last test.

## Chudnovsky Algorithm

The last algorithm was the [Chudnovsky algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm#:~:text=The%20Chudnovsky%20algorithm%20is%20a,on%20Ramanujan's%20%CF%80%20formulae), which is considered the fastest and most optimized algorithm that exists. It was able to pass all tests by calculating only 80 elements of its series.
